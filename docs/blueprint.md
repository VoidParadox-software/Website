## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#4A148C) evoking the mystery and depth of space.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue (#121E2A) to create a 'void' effect.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#6F42C1), a brighter analogous hue for highlights and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines, paired with 'Inter' for body text. Space Grotesk provides a techy and slightly unusual, interesting look, which complements the futuristic theme, and Inter will ensure body text is easily legible. 
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use custom icons with a neon or glowing effect to match the futuristic theme.
- Subtle animations and transitions to simulate cosmic phenomena.
